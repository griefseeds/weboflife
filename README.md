# WebOfLife

A clone of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in your chrome browser. Clone/Download and load the extension as a unpacked extension in your manage extensions page. There has been virtually no testing aside from my own machine, and I'm still learning more and more new things about javascript, so please submit issues when necessary.

Uses the [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) javascript library to convert the current page into a canvas. (Possible compatibility issues)

Enjoy!
